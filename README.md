#Roman Numerals Kata
#Description
I completed this kata to demonstrate my ability to apply the test-driven development process. I used Jasmine as the testing framework. The application primarly consists of two funcitons. One that converts an Arabic number to a Roman numeral. The other funciton converts a Roman numeral to an Arabic number. A full description of the kata can be found at http://agilekatas.co.uk/katas/romannumerals-kata.
#Installation
To run the application, copy all the files and folders to a folder on your computer and open the index.html file in a web browser.
